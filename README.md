## ℹ️ General Info

Proposed exercise:

> _In this exercise, you should create a simple web page using HTML and use JavaScript to practice DOM manipulation. Start by creating an HTML page with an image, text, and a button. Next, add an event listener to the button to detect clicks. When the button is clicked, you should change the image, the paragraph text, and the background color/image. For an extra challenge, make the elements return to their original state when the button is clicked again. Use [this page](https://blue-edtech.github.io/Codelab/jogo-do-humor/index.html) as an example._
